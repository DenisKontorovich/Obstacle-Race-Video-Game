TowerTreck Endless Runner

Game where the player attempts to jump on top of falling platforms to avoid falling into the lava below.
 The player has to avoid additional spikes placed on the right and left wall of the games. The player starts off with
 three lives and every time they hit any sort of spike they lose a life. When the player has zero lives left then the game is over.
 There are four types of platforms that can fall, either a regular platform, a mud platform, an ice platform, or spike platform. If a player
 lands on a mud platform it is harder for the player to move left or right, and they can't jump up as high. If they land on an ice platform
 they can easily slide off of the platform and into the lava. If the player lands on a spike platform they bounce off and lose a life.
 At the same time as all of this is occuring a power up and a health badge fall from the sky. If the player gets a health badge than they
 get one more life if they had less than 3 lives already. If the player gets a power up then they become invisible until the power up bar
 runs out where they go back to normal. While invinsible the player travels extremely fast towards the top passing by multiple platforms and 
 increasing their distance travelled and score exponentially. Note, the player can also perform a double jump if they double tap jump. However
 this can only occur when the double jump bar is full to a certain extent. If the double jump is at its lower limit than a double jump cannot occur.
 The point of the game is for the player to get the highest score possible, and distance travelled.
